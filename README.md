# Azure SQL Managed Instance Deployment Demos

These demos provides a step-by-step guide to deploy an **Azure SQL Managed Instance** using IaC, Azure CLI and PowerShell. The deployment includes setting up a Virtual Network, Subnet with necessary delegations, Network Security Group (NSG), Route Table, and the Managed Instance itself.

## Key Components

- **Virtual Network (VNet)**: A network environment for the Managed Instance.
- **Subnet**: Configured with necessary delegations and associated with NSG and Route Table.
- **Network Security Group (NSG)**: Controls network traffic with rules specific to SQL Managed Instance.
- **Route Table**: Manages network routes within the VNet.
- **Azure SQL Managed Instance**: The primary managed database service for this demo.
